# Frontend support for the MultiColumnWizard

Install this package to be able to use the [MultiColumnWizard](https://github.com/menatwork/MultiColumnWizard) (MCW) in the
frontend.

Currently the module can safely handle text fields - all other field types must be checked separately.

Adding and deleting is performed via "[Vanilla JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_JS)" - D&D porting via [Sortable.js](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable)
